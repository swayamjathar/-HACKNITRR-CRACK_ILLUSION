There are approximately 66 million people in India suffering from either complete or partial deafness, and at least 50lakh are children. These people are specially abled and not able to communicate with other beings, easily. To communicate with others they use sign language, which becomes tough for others to understand it. So circumscribing the this major issue we decided to simplfy the mode of communication between specially abled people and normal people. Introducing "वरदान" which works as a trasnlator from Sign Language to Text. The motto of "वरदान" is o create a meaningful connection with specially abled people.
